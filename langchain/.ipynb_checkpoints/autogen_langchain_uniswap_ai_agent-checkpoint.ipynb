    "# AutoGen + LangChain Use Case - Uniswap Protocol AI Agent\n",
    "\n",
    "**`AutoGen`** is a versatile framework that facilitates the creation of LLM applications by employing multiple agents capable of interacting with one another to tackle tasks. These AutoGen agents can be tailored to specific needs, engage in conversations, and seamlessly integrate human participation. They are adaptable to different operation modes that encompass the utilization of LLMs, human inputs, and various tools.\n",
    "\n",
    "**`LangChain`** is an open-source framework designed for software developers engaged in AI and ML. It enables them to seamlessly integrate LLM with external components, facilitating the creation of LLM-driven applications. The primary aim of LangChain is to establish connections between LLMs such as OpenAI's GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 and various external data sources, enabling the development and utilization of NLP applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "Both of them are playing key roles in the LLM application development.\n",
    "\n",
    "`AutoGen` doesn't support connecting to various external data sources natively. This is exactly where `LangChain` can come into play."

      "Introduction to Uniswap v3:\n",
      "\n",
      "Uniswap is an automated market maker (AMM) protocol implemented for the Ethereum Virtual Machine. It allows users to pool liquidity and make it available to traders based on predetermined rules. Uniswap v3 introduces several significant changes compared to its previous versions.\n",
      "\n",
      "Firstly, Uniswap v3 introduces multiple pools for each pair of tokens. Each pool has a different swap fee, allowing users to choose the fee tier that suits their needs. This flexibility provides more options for liquidity providers and traders.\n",
      "\n",
      "Secondly, Uniswap v3 introduces the concept of non-fungible liquidity. This means that liquidity providers can specify a range of prices within which their liquidity is available. This allows for more precise control over the liquidity provided and can potentially lead to better capital efficiency.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another important change in Uniswap v3 is the introduction of non-compounding fees. In previous versions, fees earned by liquidity providers were automatically reinvested, compounding their returns. However, in v3, fees are not automatically compounded, giving liquidity providers more control over their earnings.\n",
      "\n",
      "Uniswap v3 also introduces flexible fees, allowing liquidity providers to set custom fee structures for their pools. This enables them to align their fees with their specific strategies and risk profiles.\n",
      "\n",
      "Additionally, Uniswap v3 includes a liquidity oracle, which provides accurate and up-to-date price accumulator values. This allows users to query the oracle for recent price information, enhancing the overall trading experience.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is important to note that Uniswap v3 is designed to be non-upgradeable, ensuring the stability and security of the protocol.\n",
      "\n",
      "To use Uniswap, users need to provide liquidity to the pools and set the fee tier for each pool. They can then utilize the liquidity oracle to access recent price accumulator values. For more detailed information, please refer to the Uniswap v3 Core paper.\n",
      "\n",
