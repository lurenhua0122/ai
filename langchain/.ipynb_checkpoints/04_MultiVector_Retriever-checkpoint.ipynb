These platforms incorporate\\nprocessors, interconnects, software, algorithms, systems, and services to deliver unique value. Our platforms address four large markets where\\nour expertise is critical: Data Center, Gaming, Professional Visualization, and Automotive.\\nRevenue for the second quarter of fiscal year 2024 was $13.51 billion, up 101% from a year ago and up 88% sequentially.\\nData Center revenue was up 171% from a year ago and up 141% sequentially, led by CSPs and large consumer internet companies. Strong\\ndemand for the NVIDIA HGX platform based on our Hopper and Ampere GPU architectures was primarily driven by the development of large\\nlanguage models and generative AI. Data Center Compute grew 195% from a year ago and 157% sequentially, largely reflecting the strong ramp\\nof our Hopper-based HGX platform. Networking was up 94% from a year ago and up 85% sequentially, primarily on strong growth in InfiniBand\\ninfrastructure to support our HGX platform. In the second quarter of fiscal year 2024, CSPs represented slightly more than half of our estimated\\nData Center end demand, with large consumer internet companies being the next largest end demand, followed by enterprise and high\\nperformance computing.\\nGaming revenue was up 22% from a year ago and up 11% sequentially, primarily reflecting demand for our GeForce RTX 40 Series GPUs\\nbased on the NVIDIA Ada Lovelace architecture following normalization of channel inventory levels.\\nProfessional Visualization revenue was down 24% from a year ago and up 28% sequentially. The year-on-year decrease primarily reflects lower\\nsell-in to partners following normalization of channel inventory levels. The sequential increase was primarily due to stronger enterprise\\nworkstation demand and the ramp of NVIDIA RTX products based on the Ada Lovelace Architecture.\\nAutomotive revenue was up 15% from a year ago and down 15% sequentially. The year-on-year increase was primarily driven by sales of self-\\ndriving platforms. The sequential decrease primarily reflects lower overall auto demand, particularly in China.\\nGross margin increased from a year ago and sequentially, primarily reflecting growth in Data Center sales. The year-on-year increase also\\nreflects the impact on the year-ago gross margin from $1.34 billion in inventory provisions and related charges.\\nOperating expenses were up 10% from a year ago and up 6% sequentially, primarily driven by compensation and benefits, including stock-based\\ncompensation, reflecting growth in employees and compensation increases.\\nMarket Platform Highlights\\nData Center revenue for the second quarter of fiscal year 2024 was $10.32 billion, up 171% from a year ago. We announced that the NVIDIA\\nGH200 Grace Hopper Superchip is available in the third quarter of fiscal year 2024; announced the NVIDIA L40S GPU - a universal data center\\nprocessor for compute-intensive applications, including AI training and inference, is available now; unveiled the NVIDIA MGX server reference\\ndesign; announced NVIDIA Spectrum-X, an accelerated networking platform for AI; and partnered with a\\n27', metadata={'source': './nvidia_10q_2023.pdf', 'page': 26})"
