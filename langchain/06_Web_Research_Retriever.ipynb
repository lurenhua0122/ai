       "[Document(page_content='Effective recycling of mixed plastics waste is the next major challenge for\\nthe plastics recycling sector. The advantage is the ability to recycle a\\nlarger proportion of the plastic waste stream by expanding post-consumer\\ncollection of plastic packaging to cover a wider variety of materials and pack\\ntypes. Product design for recycling has strong potential to assist in such\\nrecycling efforts. A study carried out in the UK found that the amount of\\npackaging in a regular shopping basket that, even if collected, cannot be\\neffectively recycled, ranged from 21 to 40% (Local Government Association (UK)\\n2007). Hence, wider implementation of policies to promote the use of\\nenvironmental design principles by industry could have a large impact on\\nrecycling performance, increasing the proportion of packaging that can\\neconomically be collected and diverted from landfill (see Shaxson _et al._\\n2009). The same logic applies to durable consumer goods designing for\\ndisassembly, recycling and specifications for use of recycled resins are key\\nactions to increase recycling.', metadata={'source': 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2873020/'}),\n",

Most recycling centers will recycle plastics 1 and 2 without\\na problem. Past that, it gets tricky.\\n\\nFurthermore, a lot of plastic just isn’t recyclable curbside.

That means no cracker bags, chip\\nbags or cereal bags.\\n\\n“With plastics, it does get so confusing,” says Erin Hafner of Baltimore’s\\nrecycling program. “Clamshell containers, cutlery, plastic straws — all that\\nstuff that ends up in the [recycling] bin.” And it shouldn’t.\\n\\n_Solution: Check your city’s recycling website for the number the city takes._\\n\\n## **6\\\\.

       " Document(page_content='The effectiveness of post-consumer packaging recycling could be dramatically\\nincreased if the diversity of materials were to be rationalized to a subset of\\ncurrent usage. For example, if rigid plastic containers ranging from bottles,\\njars to trays were all PET, HDPE and PP, without clear PVC or PS, which are\\nproblematic to sort from co-mingled recyclables, then all rigid plastic\\npackaging could be collected and sorted to make recycled resins with minimal\\ncross-contamination. The losses of rejected material and the value of the\\nrecycled resins would be enhanced. In addition, labels and adhesive materials\\nshould be selected to maximize recycling performance. Improvements in\\nsorting/separation within recycling plants give further potential for both\\nhigher recycling volumes, and better eco-efficiency by decreasing waste\\nfractions, energy and water use (see §3). The goals should be to maximize both\\nthe volume and quality of recycled resins.\\n\\n## 9\\\\. Conclusions\\n\\nIn summary, recycling is one strategy for end-of-life waste management of\\nplastic products. It makes increasing sense economically as well as\\nenvironmentally and recent trends demonstrate a substantial increase in the\\nrate of recovery and recycling of plastic wastes. These trends are likely to\\ncontinue, but some significant challenges still exist from both technological\\nfactors and from economic or social behaviour issues relating to the\\ncollection of recyclable wastes, and substitution for virgin material.', metadata={'source': 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2873020/'}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='### (f) Alternative materials\\n\\nBiodegradable plastics have the potential to solve a number of waste-\\nmanagement issues, especially for disposable packaging that cannot be easily\\nseparated from organic waste in catering or from agricultural applications. It\\nis possible to include biodegradable plastics in aerobic composting, or by\\nanaerobic digestion with methane capture for energy use. However,\\nbiodegradable plastics also have the potential to complicate waste management\\nwhen introduced without appropriate technical attributes, handling systems and\\nconsumer education. In addition, it is clear that there could be significant\\nissues in sourcing sufficient biomass to replace a large proportion of the\\ncurrent consumption of polymers, as only 5 per cent of current European\\nchemical production uses biomass as feedstock (Soetaert & Vandamme 2006). This\\nis a large topic that cannot be covered in this paper, except to note that it\\nis desirable that compostable and degradable plastics are appropriately\\nlabelled and used in ways that complement, rather than compromise waste-\\nmanagement schemes (see Song _et al_. 2009).\\n\\n## 3\\\\. Systems for plastic recycling\\n\\nPlastic materials can be recycled in a variety of ways and the ease of\\nrecycling varies among polymer type, package design and product type.
